HOW IT WORKS ?
Anyone can download the application fronm play store and eaisly install it on your perosonal device or store device
there is basically two text views 
1) is for the current number of people 
2) is for the total number of customer for the entire day
there will be warning message after we hit the limit of number of customers 
the app basically follows a green theme

by using the application we will get the total number of customers for the entire day

When a customer leave the store we can simply press the minus button and the curent count will be decresed but the total number wont be affected  by this 
which means we can easily track both numbers
